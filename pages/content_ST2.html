                <p>
                    Coral reefs are among the most diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth. 
                    Often called "rainforests of the sea," coral reefs form complex, 
                    three-dimensional structures that provide habitats for approximately 25% of 
                    all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. 
                    These vibrant underwater ecosystems are built by colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps, 
                    which secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that provide the reef structure.
                </p>
                <P>
                    Despite their immense ecological importance, coral reefs face numerous threats globally. 
                    Climate change leads to rising ocean temperatures and acidification, 
                    causing coral bleaching and reduced calcification. Pollution from agricultural runoff and untreated sewage, 
                    overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and coastal development further endanger these fragile ecosystems. 
                    Without immediate and comprehensive conservation efforts, we risk losing up to 90% of the world's 
                    coral reefs within the next few decades.

                            Climate change poses a significant threat to coral reefs worldwide. 
                            Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel the algae living in their tissues, 
                            turning them white. Without the algae, corals lose their primary source of nutrition and become more susceptible to disease. 
                            If the stress persists, corals may die, leading to the loss of entire reef ecosystems. 
                            Ocean acidification, another consequence of climate change, reduces the availability of calcium carbonate, 
                            making it harder for corals to build their skeletons and maintain reef structures.
