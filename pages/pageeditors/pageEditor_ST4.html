                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            The profile page is structured using &lt;div&gt; tags to separate different sections, making it easier to apply styling. The profile section, which includes the profile image, cover image, and related content, is styled using display: flex with justify-content: center and a column flex direction to align elements effectively. Social media icons are implemented using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for better scalability. The "About" and "Who am I" sections are placed side by side within a common container using flex display, a technique also applied to the skills and experience sections. Section dividers are created using the &lt;hr&gt; tag, while the progress bar effect is achieved through a &lt;div&gt; with custom styling. Links in the experience section are styled with :hover effects for interactivity. Different UN goals are presented in individual cards containing links to their respective pages. The volunteering availability section includes a calendar, where the &lt;span&gt; tag is used to apply styling within a &lt;div&gt;. The calendar layout is structured using grid-template-columns to maintain uniform spacing. A "Contact Me" button triggers a modal form using JavaScript, allowing users to input data with relevant form field types. Hover effects are applied to content sections and buttons to enhance visual appeal, and a background image is added for a more engaging design.

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I used meaningful tags like &lt;header>, &lt;section>, &lt;h2>, and &lt;p> instead of just &lt;div> to enhance screen reader navigation.</li>
                            <li>All images, including the profile and cover images, have alt attributes to provide descriptive text for users relying on screen readers.</li>
                            <li>Interactive elements like buttons and links are styled appropriately and can be navigated using the Tab key, improving usability for those who don't use a mouse.</li>
                            <li>The text colors and backgrounds maintain sufficient contrast to be readable for users with visual impairments.</li>
                            <li>I implemented :hover styles on buttons and links to improve visibility when users navigate.</li>
                            <li>The page uses percentages for layout elements to support zooming and different screen sizes without breaking the design</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2 id="volunteer">Sitemap Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            The sitemap page is structured using an &lt;svg>-based layout to visually represent the website's structure, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation. The page is styled with a full-width background image for a visually engaging experience. The central title is positioned using text-align: center and a large font size for emphasis. The sitemap itself is constructed with SVG elements, where each main section is represented as a rectangular node (&lt;rect class="node">), styled with a light blue fill and a transition effect for hover interactions. Sub-sections are created using &lt;rect class="sub_node">, maintaining a consistent design with white-filled rectangles and smooth hover transitions. Connecting lines (&lt;line class="line">) are drawn to visually link parent and child nodes, enhancing the hierarchical structure. Text labels (&lt;text>) are centered within each node using text-anchor: middle and dominant-baseline: middle for proper alignment. Interactive elements are made clickable through onclick functions that trigger JavaScript navigation. Additionally, hyperlinks (&lt;a> tags) allow external access to relevant pages. The grid-based alignment of elements is controlled using transform matrices, ensuring a structured and evenly spaced display. Hover effects (:hover) on nodes and sub-nodes provide visual feedback by changing colors and strokes when hovered. The page maintains accessibility features, such as tabindex="0" for keyboard navigation and color contrasts for readability. The overall design ensures a user-friendly and interactive visualization of the website's structure while maintaining responsiveness and ease of navigation.
                        </p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>

                            <li>Interactive elements such as nodes (&lt;rect> elements) and links are assigned tabindex="0", ensuring users can navigate the sitemap using the Tab key without requiring a mouse.</li>
